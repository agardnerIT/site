So, what *do* sunglasses have to do with software performance?

For the moment, leave aside the **marketing** aspect. The *how* you found out that these sunglasses were good quality. For the purpose of this post, I include price in the marketing aspect as pricing and discounts really are a function of marketing. When a consumer purchases on price alone, they're purchasing on marketing alone, not quality. See [loss leaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader) as one example strategy for this.

We'll focus instead on two areas:

1. The customer (or prospective buyer) perspective of **why** they believe the sunglasses are good quality
1. The business perspective of **how** they drove that perception of quality

This really isn't rocket science but it amazes me how many companies **still** (in 2021) neglect these (to me) basic guiding principles.

## Two Opportunities
If my company is in the business of manufacturing sunglasses, it has two opportunities to improve the quality of the glasses and the perception of my company:

1. During the design & manufacture cycle
1. During the post sales cycle

### Quality During Design and Manufacture
How does my company differentiate our sunglasses from every other market player? Perhaps we invest in better R&D so our **shapes** are better, different or more suited to our customer profile than our competitors. We invest in **style**.

Perhaps we invest in **better materials**? Clearer lenses, scratch resistant coatings, UV protections, polarisation technology and so forth. Maybe the materials from which make the frames are lighter weight or more durable so the glasses don't break as easily as the competitors glasses. We invest in **quality**.

> In short, we improve the quality of the product that goes out the door.

### Post Sales Quality
So a customer has purchased and comes to you with an issue. Their glasses are defective in some way. The quicker you fix (or remediate) their issue, the better they will think of your product and company.

Do you offer **free exchanges** (over and above consumer protection laws) for faults? If so, how **effortless**, **quick** and **cheap** is the process for me to get the glasses back to you?

Do you take that one step further and offer exchanges **even if they aren't faulty**? Do you offer **24/7 support**? Perhaps you offer a money back guarantee or free exchanges if they don't suit within a certain time period?

> In short, how quickly and accurately can you fix my issue and make me happy again?

## Software = Sunglasses
The software your company produces really is no different from my sunglasses. You too have two opportunities to improve quality of your software:

1. Better software into production in the first place
1. If and when things go wrong (and they will) how fast you remediate those issues and return customers to their happy state

### Final Thoughts
As I said at the beginning, this isn't rocket science but companies I deal with still regularly either struggle to achieve this or (worse) seem to ignore these basic principles.

To me, the worse the two above things are, the more money you have to spend on marketing to "paper over the cracks", so to me, this just makes sense! Then again, I'm not in marketing so maybe I'm missing something!?

I'm keen to know **your** experiences:

- What have you / your company tried or implemented in this area?
- What worked, what didn't? What have you learned or unlearned (old habits die hard)?
- Where did you adapt (either organically or by force)?
- Where did you succeeded or fail?
- What blockers are you facing?
