This video shows how to run Infracost with Keptn and the Job Executor Service.

It also demonstrates how to push metrics to an observability backend (Prometheus is used in this video). Finally a Keptn quality gate is executed which checks the output of Infracost.

Now your FinOps data can be included in your pipeline go / no go decisions alongside SRE metrics like response time, availability and throughput.
