I asked ChatGPT to write an article about [Keptn](https://keptn.sh)...

# Do it for me ChatGPT...

Here is ChatGPT's response:

The world of software development is constantly evolving, and with it, the tools and processes that teams use to deliver software. One of the most promising developments in recent years has been the rise of cloud-native technologies such as Kubernetes and Istio, which have enabled teams to build, deploy and operate their applications in a more efficient and scalable way. However, as teams adopt these new technologies, they also face new challenges when it comes to automating their software delivery process.

This is where Keptn comes in. Keptn is an open-source project that provides a platform for continuous delivery and automated operations of cloud-native applications. It enables teams to automate their software delivery process, from development to production, by providing a set of automation capabilities that can be integrated with existing tools and processes.

One of the key features of Keptn is its ability to automate the deployment and rollback of applications. This means that teams can deploy new versions of their applications with the click of a button, and quickly roll back to a previous version if something goes wrong. This can save teams a lot of time and effort, and help them to deliver software faster and more reliably.

Another important feature of Keptn is its ability to automate testing and validation of deployments. With Keptn, teams can define automated tests that are run automatically after a deployment, ensuring that the new version of the application is working as expected. This can help teams to catch issues early on, before they become a problem in production.

Keptn also provides automated remediation of issues, which means that if something goes wrong, the platform can automatically take action to fix the problem. This can save teams a lot of time and effort, and help them to keep their applications running smoothly.

In addition to these features, Keptn also provides automated root-cause analysis, which helps teams to quickly identify the cause of an issue. This can be especially helpful in complex systems where the root cause of a problem is not always obvious.

Finally, Keptn provides automated monitoring and observability, which enables teams to see how their applications are performing in real-time. This can help teams to identify issues early on, and to make informed decisions about how to improve the performance of their applications.

Keptn is built on top of popular open-source projects such as Prometheus, Grafana, and kubectl, and it integrates well with other tools and platforms such as Jenkins, GitHub, and Prometheus. This means that teams can easily integrate Keptn into their existing workflow, making it easy to start automating their software delivery process.

In conclusion, Keptn is a powerful open-source platform that can help teams to automate their software delivery process, from development to production. With its ability to automate deployment, testing, remediation, and monitoring, Keptn can help teams to deliver software faster and more reliably, and to keep their applications running smoothly. If you're looking for a way to automate your software delivery process, Keptn is definitely worth checking out.

# Back to the Human

Not bad really, but to me, it doesn't "feel" human. Remember at school or uni where you'd look over someone's work and just "know" it wasn't them - sure, they hadn't "plagiarised" but it the sentences were "heavily inspired" by other content and they'd wrapped some nice conjunctions around it to make it feel human.

Then again, maybe I'm jealous, all humans are soon to be useless and we're just watching our usefulness clock tick away...

Don't get me wrong, we ignore ChatGPT at our peril - it is a gamechanger - we would be foolish to dismiss it outright. The combination of deep fakes, ChatGPT and vocal synthesis is something we simply aren't ready for. The spam and phishing resulting from that will make those "you have an unpaid Amazon bill" emails and SMS's feel antiquated.

No doubt ChatGPT has lots of smarts and the time-savings can be immense. I just don't think that we are redundant, yet...
