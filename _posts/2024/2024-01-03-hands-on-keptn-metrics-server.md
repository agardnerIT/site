The Keptn metrics server is a tool which enables developers to retrieve metrics from any / many sources, store them in an on-cluster cache and treat them completely generically. You no longer need to worry about where they came from, just "get me the value of metric `foo`" regardless of the metric source.

I've wrote this as a hands-on blog over on `dev.to`: [Hands on with Keptn Metrics Server: Pull Metrics from anywhere and treat them generically](https://dev.to/agardnerit/hands-on-pull-metrics-into-kubernetes-from-anywhere-and-treat-them-generically-with-the-keptn-metrics-server-1c5n).
